Movie Genre Prediction
Welcome to the Movie Genre Prediction project! Iâ€™m Vanshaj Awasthi, a student currently studying in my 2nd year of BTech Computer Science and Engineering. In this project, we explore how we can use machine learning to guess the genre of a movie just by reading a short description of the movie

Introduction
Predicting the genre of a movie from its plot summary can be challenging yet fascinating. This project demonstrates how we can utilize various machine learning techniques, such as TF-IDF for feature extraction and models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict movie genres.

Dataset
The dataset consists of movie descriptions divided into training and test sets. The training data includes movie IDs, titles, genres, and descriptions, while the test data includes only movie IDs, titles, and descriptions.

Example Format
Training Data:
ID ::: TITLE ::: GENRE ::: DESCRIPTION
1 ::: Oscar et la dame rose (2009) ::: drama ::: Listening in to a conversation between his doctor and parents, 10-year-old Oscar learns what nobody has the courage to tell him...

#Test Data:

ID ::: TITLE ::: DESCRIPTION
1 ::: Edgar's Lunch (1998) ::: L.R. Brane loves his life - his car, his apartment, his job, but especially his girlfriend, Vespa...

#Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CODSOFT.git
cd CODSOFT/MovieGenrePrediction

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

Prepare Data: Place your training and test data files in the data directory.
Run the Model: Execute the following command to train the model and make predictions:
sh

Model Details
This project uses the following techniques and models:

TF-IDF Vectorization: To convert textual data into numerical features.
Logistic Regression: For binary and multi-class classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): To find the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks.
Grid Search: For hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

#Results
The model achieved the following results on the validation set:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 82%
Recall: 80%
F1 Score: 81%
These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting movie genres from plot summaries.

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction

I’m **Vanshaj Awasthi**, a BTech CSE 2nd Year student. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service.

## Project Overview

We use historical customer data to train models that predict whether a customer will stop using the service. We evaluate models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best one for this task.

## Features of the Dataset

- **CreditScore**: Customer's creditworthiness score.
- **Geography**: Country of residence (France, Spain, Germany).
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Duration of the customer’s subscription.
- **Balance**: Account balance of the customer.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member.
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer’s estimated salary.
- **Exited**: Whether the customer has left the service.
